## Differentiating the Player Discussion

### Goals
- Give each of the players
- Unique and Different and Specific
- Tasks, Abilities, Visions
- Want P1 and P2 to spend a significant amount of timing just communicating

### Planning
- Both P1 and P2 need to think about what to do next to react to enemies

### Aiming
- P1 has to aim at specific enemies
- P1 vision is narrow and detailed
- P1 has to choose the right kind of ammo

### Moving
- P2 must move the player around
- P2 vision is broad and peripheral

### Reloading
- P1 must perform

### Dodging
- P2 has to avoid incoming attacks

### Collecting
- P2 has to find more ammo







## Differentiating the Player Definitions

### Unique, Different, Specific
- Unique: Task A is significantly different from Task B
- Different: P1 does Task A, P2 does Task B
- Specific: Task have many steps to make them specific

### Tasks, Abilities, Visions
- Task: Sequence of Actions to fulfill an Ability's Effect
- Ability:
- Vision: What a Player can see/know







## Split Screen Discussion
- Instead of both players seeing the same thing, we can differ what each sees
- Advantage is to tailor their perspective and make their part of the game more specific
- This means hints can be specific, as can tasks
