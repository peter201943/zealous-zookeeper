# Team 2 Project 2 Meeting 2






## Demos
- Erjun
- Peter







## Basis
- 2D or 3D
- Peter: Prefer 3D for logic
- Erjun: 2D v 3D for logic is not that large a difference
- Peter: Do not want 3D assets necessarily
- Peter: Consider [Enter the Gungeon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enter_the_Gungeon)
  - [It is a 2D game in presentation](https://dodgeroll.com/gungeon/images/screenshots/screenshot1.png)
  - [But the logic is actually 3D](https://twitter.com/dodgerollgames/status/593625936131653632)
- Dawei: Like to use TileMap
- Peter: Can we control tilemap with Groups?
- Dawei: Yes








## More Variety
- Dawei: Want player to follow a path
- Dawei: Do not just want waves
- Dawei: 
- Peter: Think variety of enemy composition per wave should be our focus
- Erjun: More varied environment? (Sandpits, Boulders, etc)









## Split Vision
- Peter: Use Split Screens, one for Mover, one for Shooter
- Dawei: Why?
- Peter: [Like Tank Crews, dedicated controls, roles, and perspectives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tank#/media/File:British_Sherman_tank_Italy_Dec_1943_IWM_NA_9992.jpg)
- Erjun: Split screen 







## Sufficient Difficulty
- Dawei: Worried about screen cheating
- Peter: Have enemy movement be complex enough to busy the players






## What do we Want from the Map?
- Dawei: Want map somewhat explorable and not static, like my last project (Ant game)
- Peter: Was thinking we would just have 1 simple map with predefined and grouped spawn locations
- Erjun: We should have some ability to walk around the map
- Dawei: Want some story






## How to Teach the Player
- Peter: Want tooltips
- Erjun: Want to make a tutorial level
  - Be really simple
  - Put bananas next to monkeys
  - Put spawns of each item next to food
