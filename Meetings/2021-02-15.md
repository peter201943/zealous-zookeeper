## Team Fortress 2 Heavy and Medic Dynamic
- Peter: (Explain TF2 Dynamic)
- Peter: Two separate pieces that are whole
- Peter: Better when joined together
- Peter: These games are all about splitting a single character in two
- Frank: Feels like there are very obvious Primary and Secondary characters
- Frank: Design fights for heavy dependences upon particular classes
- Austin: I feel like one of the best co-ops that makes it so that the players are equals is portal since both players are almost exactly the same and it is a bunch of puzzles. Other than ones like that, it is hard to make a lesser subclass be more than a passive role
